### Objective
I wrote a Psychopy experiment for an exam project. The goal was to create an intervention for improving jugdement under unceartainty, in a politically contentious context. The experiment tests two groups. Both have to give an binary(True/False) answer to a statement and a confidence rating.

### Intervention
The intervention group gives their confidence rating by wagering points, calculated as the optimal bet (by kelly criterion) given their current number of points and their confidence scores.

### Outcomes
Sample size was too small to make any judgement. Task might have been a little too complicated as well. Participants could also become stuck at 0 points in the intervention group. This should probably be safeguarded against even though it techinally dissallows some optimal bets.
